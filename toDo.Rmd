## Getting started.  28 Oct 2020.  

I think some nice, clean summary charts to start would be valuable and suggest that first you make a new datasheet where you have removed all rows where disturbance is AlternativeSuccession, NonFireDisturbances, NonReplacementFire, etc.  Then try making these: 

* a horizonal bar chart with disturbances on the vertical axis and acres on the horizontal axis
* ditto above, but with percentages
* a grouped bar, where the "clusters" of bars are groupVeg, and the size of the bars is based on acres (or percent) of the different disturbance types
